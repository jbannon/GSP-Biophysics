# Graph Signal Processing for Biophysical Property Prediction


Using Graph Signal Processing for Biophysical property prediction

This repo is designed to perform experiments on biophysical property prediction for datasets from TDCommon.


Specifically we focus on two regression tasks and one classification task:

* Hydration Free Energy (HFE) - Regresion
* Lipophilicity (LIPO) - Regression
* Membrane Permeability (MP) - Classification


NOTE:: processing LIPO and MP produce files too large for git to push so they should be run remotely
